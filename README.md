# AI Learnings

A personal knowledge base where I document and reflect on things I learn while working with AI tools and workflows.  
This repo is meant to be a growing collection of notes, experiments, and insights.

## Contents

- **claude.md** â€” Notes on using Claude, including observations, tips, and takeaways.

## Purpose

- Track progress and lessons learned over time  
- Keep references organized in one place  
- Build a resource I can revisit and expand as I go
